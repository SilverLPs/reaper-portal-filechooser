- Adding file dialogues (if possible) for:
  - Save project/Save project as
  - Save new version of project
  - Save project as template
  - Render to file
  - And maybe much more stuff like adding plugin folders etc.

- Verifying that current-folder and current-file work in more modern versions of xdg-desktop-portal (would make the implemented last directory mechanism work, so every REAPER action would save its own last path)
- Heavy testing under X11/Native, Wayland/Native, X11/Flatpak, Wayland/Flatpak and also GTK and KDE
- ReaPack and automatic install and uninstall script, including adding menu entries
- Make a README.md with before-after screenshots, explanations and easy install instructions

- The KDE dialog is smart enough to show both RPP and rpp but the GTK dialog will only show RPP if the filter is set. Switching the filter to .rpp and .RPP would solve that but it would also make it so that multiple extensions will be returned to the Lua script which could invoke new problems. Maybe there is common publicly known solution to this.

- Python script has a fallback to selected_filter if current_filter isn't received in DBus method_return. But selected_filter is unspecified in xdg-desktop-portals, it is probably completely unnecessary and should be removed. In fact no fallback should be necessary, not even to RPP, because falling back to RPP is the job of the Lua script.
