- Adding file dialogues (if possible) for:
  - Save project/Save project as
  - Save new version of project
  - Save project as template
  - Render to file
  - And maybe much more stuff like adding plugin folders etc.

- Verifying that current-folder and current-file work in more modern versions of xdg-desktop-portal (would make the implemented last directory mechanism work, so every REAPER action would save its own last path)
- Heavy testing under X11/Native, Wayland/Native, X11/Flatpak, Wayland/Flatpak and also GTK and KDE
- ReaPack and automatic install and uninstall script, including adding menu entries
- Make a README.md with before-after screenshots, explanations and easy install instructions
